[eBook #24051]Language: Chinese*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 李娃傳 ***汧國夫人李娃﹐長安之倡女也。節行瑰奇﹐有足稱者。故監察御史向行簡為傳述。天寶中﹐有常州刺史滎陽公者﹐略其名氏﹐不書﹐時望甚崇﹐家徒甚慇。知命之年﹐有一子﹐始弱冠矣﹐雋朗有詞藻﹐迥然不群﹐深為時輩推伏。其父愛而器之﹐曰﹕“此吾家千里駒也。”應鄉賦秀才舉﹐將行﹐乃盛其服玩車馬之飾﹐計其京師薪儲之費。謂之曰﹕“吾觀爾之才﹐當一戰而霸。今備二載之用﹐且豐爾之給﹐將為其志也。”生亦自負視上第如指掌。自毗陵發﹐月余抵長安﹐居于布政裡。嘗游東市還﹐自平康東門入﹐將訪友于西南。至鳴珂曲﹐見一宅﹐門庭不甚廣﹐而室宇嚴邃﹐闔一扉。有娃方憑一雙鬟青衣立﹐妖姿要妙﹐絕代未有。生忽見之﹐不覺停驂久之﹐徘徊不能去。乃詐墜鞭于地﹐候其從者﹐敕取之﹐累眄于娃﹐娃回眸凝睇﹐情甚相慕﹐竟不敢措辭而去。生自爾意若有失﹐乃密征其友游長安之熟者以訊之。友曰﹕“此狹邪女李氏宅也。”曰﹕“娃可求乎﹖”對曰﹕“李氏頗贍﹐前與通之者﹐多貴戚豪族﹐所得甚廣﹐非累百萬﹐不能動其志也。”生曰﹕“苟患其不諧﹐雖百萬﹐何惜﹗”他日﹐乃潔其衣服﹐盛賓從而往。扣其門﹐俄有侍兒啟扃。生曰﹕“此誰之第耶﹖”侍兒不答﹐馳走大呼曰﹕“前時遺策郎也。”娃大悅曰﹕“爾姑止之﹐吾當整妝易服而出。”生聞之﹐私喜。乃引至蕭牆間﹐見一姥垂白上僂﹐即娃母也。生跪拜前致詞曰﹕“聞茲地有隙院﹐願稅以居﹐信乎﹖”姥曰﹕“懼其淺陋湫隘﹐不足以辱長者所處﹐安敢言直耶﹖”延生于遲賓之館﹐館宇甚麗。與生偶坐﹐因曰﹕“某有女嬌小﹐技藝薄劣﹐欣見賓客﹐願將見之。”乃命娃出﹐明眸皓腕﹐舉步艷冶。生遂驚起﹐莫敢仰視。與之拜畢﹐敘寒燠﹐觸類妍媚﹐目所未睹。復坐﹐烹茶斟酒﹐器用甚潔。久之日暮﹐鼓聲四動。姥訪其居遠近。生之曰﹕“在延平門外數裡。”冀其遠而見留也。姥曰﹕“鼓已發矣﹐當速歸﹐無犯禁。”生曰﹕“幸接歡笑﹐不知日之雲夕。道裡遼闊﹐城內又無親戚﹐將若之何﹖”娃曰﹕“不見責僻陋﹐方將居之﹐宿何害焉。”生數目姥﹐姥曰﹕“唯唯。”生乃召其家僮﹐持雙縑﹐請以備一宵之饌。娃笑而止之曰﹕“賓主之儀﹐且不然也。今夕之費﹐願以貧窶之家﹐隨其粗以進之。其餘以俟他辰。”固辭﹐終不許。俄徙坐西堂﹐帷幕帘榻﹐煥然奪目﹔妝奩衾枕。亦皆侈麗。乃張燭進饌﹐品味甚盛。徹饌﹐姥起。生娃談話方切﹐詼諧調笑﹐無所不至。生曰﹕“前偶過卿門﹐遇卿適在屏間。厥後心常勤念﹐雖寢與食﹐未嘗或舍。”娃答曰﹕“我心亦如之。”生曰﹕“今之來﹐非直求居而已﹐願償平生之志。但未知命也若何。”言未終﹐姥至﹐詢其故﹐具以告。姥笑曰﹕“男女之際﹐大欲存焉。情苟相得﹐雖父母之命﹐不能制也。女子固陋﹐曷足以荐君子之枕蓆﹗”生遂下階﹐拜而謝之曰﹕“願以己為養。”姥遂目之為郎﹐飲酣而散。及旦﹐盡徙其囊橐﹐因家于李之第。自是生屏跡戢身﹐不復與親知相聞﹐日會倡優儕類﹐狎戲游宴。囊中盡空﹐乃鬻駿乘及其家僮。歲余﹐資財仆馬蕩然。邇來姥意漸怠﹐娃情彌篤。他日﹐娃謂生曰﹕“與郎相知一年﹐尚無孕嗣。常聞竹林神者﹐報應如響﹐將致荐酹求之﹐可乎﹖”生不知其計﹐大喜。乃質衣于肆﹐以備牢醴﹐與娃同謁祠宇而禱祝焉﹐信宿而返。策驢而後﹐至裡北門﹐娃謂生曰﹕“此東轉小曲中﹐某之姨宅也﹐將憩而覲之﹐可乎﹖”生如其言﹐前行不逾百步﹐果見一車門。窺其際﹐甚弘敞。其青衣自車後止之曰﹕“至矣。”生下﹐適有一人出訪曰﹕“誰﹖”曰﹕“李娃也。”乃入告。俄有一嫗至﹐年可四十餘﹐與生相迎曰﹕“吾甥來否﹖”娃下車﹐嫗逆訪之曰﹕“何久髮絕﹖”相視而笑。娃引生拜之﹐既見﹐遂偕入西戟門偏院。中有山亭﹐竹樹蔥茜﹐池榭幽絕。生謂娃曰﹕“此姨之私第耶﹖”笑而不答﹐以他語對。俄獻茶果﹐甚珍奇。食頃﹐有一人控大宛﹐汗流馳至曰﹕“姥遇暴疾頗甚﹐殆不識人﹐宜速歸。”娃謂姨曰﹕“方寸亂矣﹐某騎而前去﹐當令返乘﹐便與郎偕來。”生擬隨之﹐其姨與侍兒偶語﹐以手揮之﹐令生止于戶外﹐曰﹕“姥且歿矣﹐當與某議喪事﹐以濟其急﹐奈何遽相隨而去﹖”乃止﹐共計其凶儀齋祭之用。日晚﹐乘不至。姨言曰﹕“無復命何也﹖郎驟往覘之﹐某當繼至。”生遂往﹐至舊宅﹐門扁鑰甚密﹐以泥緘之。生大駭﹐詰其鄰人。鄰人曰﹕“李本稅此而居﹐約已周矣。第主自收﹐姥徙居而且再宿矣。”征徙何處﹐曰﹕“不詳其所。”生將馳赴宣陽﹐以詰其姨﹐日已晚矣﹐計程不能達。乃弛其裝服﹐質饌而食﹐賃榻而寢﹐生恚怒方甚﹐自昏達旦﹐目不交睫。質明﹐乃策蹇而去。既至﹐連扣其扉﹐食頃無人應。生大呼數四﹐有宦者徐出。生遽訪之﹕“姨氏在乎﹖”曰﹕“無之。”生曰﹕“昨暮在此﹐何故匿之﹖”訪其誰氏之第﹐曰﹕“此崔高書宅。昨者有一人稅此院﹐雲遲中表之遠至者﹐未暮去矣。”生惶惑發狂﹐罔知所措﹐因返訪布政舊邸。邸主哀而進膳。生怨懣﹐絕食三日﹐遘疾甚篤﹐旬余愈甚。邸主懼其不起﹐徙之于凶肆之中。綿綴移時﹐合肆之人﹐共傷嘆而互飼之。後稍愈﹐杖而能起。由是凶肆日假之﹐令執繐帷﹐獲其直以自給。累月﹐漸復壯﹐每聽其哀歌﹐自嘆不及逝者﹐輒嗚咽流涕﹐不能自止。歸則效之。生聰敏者也﹐無何﹐曲盡其妙﹐雖長安無有倫比。初﹐二肆之佣凶器者﹐互爭勝負。其東肆車輿皆奇麗﹐殆不敵。唯哀挽劣焉。其東肆長知生妙絕﹐乃醵錢二萬索顧焉。其黨耆舊﹐共較其所能者﹐陰教生新聲﹐而相贊和。累旬﹐人莫知之。其二肆長相謂曰﹕“我欲各閱所佣之器于天門街﹐以較優劣。不勝者﹐罰直五萬﹐以備酒饌之用﹐可乎﹖”二肆許諾﹐乃邀立符契﹐署以保證﹐然後閱之。士女大和會﹐聚至數萬。於是裡胥告于賊曹﹐賊曹聞于京尹。四方之士﹐盡赴趨焉﹐巷無居人。自旦閱之﹐及亭午﹐歷舉輦輿威儀之具﹐西肆皆不勝﹐師有慚色。乃置層榻于南隅﹐有長髯者﹐擁鐸而進﹐翊衛數人﹐於是奮髯揚眉﹐扼腕頓顙而登﹐乃歌《白馬》之詞。恃其夙勝﹐顧眄左右﹐旁若無人。齊聲讚揚之﹐自以為獨步一時﹐不可得而屈也。有頃﹐東肆長于北隅上設連榻﹐有烏巾少年﹐左右五六人﹐秉翣而至﹐即生也。整衣服﹐俯仰甚徐﹐申喉發調﹐容若不勝。乃歌《薤露》之章﹐舉聲清越﹐響振林木。曲度未終﹐聞者歔欷掩泣。西肆長為眾所誚﹐益慚恥﹐密置所輸之直于前﹐乃潛遁焉。四座愕眙﹐莫之測也。先是天子方下詔﹐俾外方之牧﹐歲一至闕下﹐謂之入計。時也﹐適遇生之父在京師﹐與同列者易服章﹐竊往觀焉。有老豎﹐即生乳母婿也﹐見生之舉措辭氣﹐將認之而未敢﹐乃泫然流涕。生父驚而詰之﹐因告曰﹕“歌者之貌﹐酷似郎之亡子。”父曰﹕“吾子以多財為盜所害﹐奚至是耶﹖”言訖﹐亦泣。及歸﹐豎間馳往﹐訪于同黨曰﹕“向歌者誰﹐若斯之妙歟﹖”皆曰﹕“某氏之子。”征其名﹐且易之矣﹐豎凜然大驚。徐往﹐迫而察之。生見豎﹐色動回翔﹐將匿于眾中。豎遂持其袂曰﹕“豈非某乎﹖”相持而泣﹐遂載以歸。至其室﹐父責曰﹕“志行若此﹐污辱吾門﹐何施面目﹐復相見也﹖”乃徒行出﹐至曲江西杏園東﹐去其衣服。以馬鞭鞭之數百。生不勝其苦而斃﹐父棄之而去。其師命相狎昵者﹐陰隨之﹐歸告同黨﹐共加傷嘆。令二人葦席瘞焉。至則心下微溫﹐舉之良久﹐氣稍通。因共荷而歸﹐以葦筒灌勺飲﹐經宿乃活。月余﹐手足不能自舉﹐其楚撻之處皆潰爛﹐穢甚。同輩患之﹐一夕棄于道周。行路咸傷之﹐往往投其餘食﹐得以充腸。十旬﹐方杖策而起。被布裘﹐裘有百結﹐襤褸如懸鶉。持一破甌巡于閭裡﹐以乞食為事。自秋徂冬﹐夜入于糞壤窟室﹐晝則週游廛肆。一旦大雪﹐生為凍餒所驅。冒雪而出﹐乞食之聲甚苦﹐聞見者莫不淒惻。時雪方甚﹐人家外戶多不發。至安邑東門﹐循裡垣﹐北轉第七八﹐有一門獨啟左扉﹐即娃之第也。生不知之﹐遂連聲疾呼﹕“飢凍之甚。”音響淒切﹐所不忍聽。娃自閣中聞之﹐謂侍兒曰﹕“此必生也﹐我辨其音矣。”連步而出。見生枯瘠疥癘﹐殆非人狀。娃意感焉﹐乃謂曰﹕“豈非某郎也﹖”生憤懣絕倒﹐口不能言﹐頷頤而已。娃前抱其頸﹐以繡襦擁而歸于西廂。失聲長慟曰﹕“令子一朝及此﹐我之罪也。”絕而復甦。姥大駭奔至﹐曰﹕“何也﹖”娃曰﹕“某郎。”姥遽曰﹕“當逐之﹐奈何令至此。”娃斂容卻睇曰﹕“不然﹐此良家子也﹐當昔驅高車﹐持金裝﹐至某之室﹐不踰期而蕩盡。且互設詭計﹐舍而逐之﹐殆非人行。令其失志﹐不得齒于人倫。父子之道﹐天性也。使其情絕﹐殺而棄之﹐又困躓若此。天下之人﹐盡知為某也。生親戚滿朝﹐一旦當權者熟察其本末﹐禍將及矣。況欺天負人﹐鬼神不祐﹐無自貽其殃也。某為姥子﹐迨今有二十歲矣。計其貲﹐不啻直千金。今姥年六十餘﹐願計二十年衣食之用以贖身﹐當與此子別卜所詣。所詣非遙﹐晨昏得以溫清﹐某願足矣。”姥度其志不可奪﹐因許之。給姥之余﹐有百金。北隅四五家﹐稅一隙院。乃與生沐浴﹐易其衣服﹐為湯粥通其腸﹐次以酥乳潤其臟。旬余﹐方荐水陸之饌。頭巾履襪﹐皆取珍異者衣之。未數月﹐肌膚稍腴。卒歲﹐平愈如初。異時﹐娃謂生曰﹕“體已康矣﹐志已壯矣。淵思寂慮﹐默想曩昔之藝業﹐可溫習乎﹖”生思之曰﹕“十得二三耳。”娃命車出游﹐生騎而從。至旗亭南偏門鬻墳典之肆﹐令生揀而市之﹐計費百金﹐盡載以歸。因令生斥棄百慮以志學﹐俾夜作晝﹐孜孜矻矻。娃常偶坐﹐宵分乃寐。伺其疲倦﹐即諭之綴詩賦。二歲而業大就﹐海內文籍﹐莫不該覽。生謂娃曰﹕“可策名試藝矣。”娃曰﹕“未也﹐且令精熟﹐以俟百戰。”更一年﹐曰﹕“可行矣。”於是遂一上登甲科﹐聲振禮闈。雖前輩見其文﹐罔不斂衽敬羨﹐願友之而不可得。娃曰﹕“未也。今秀士苟獲擢一科第﹐則自謂可以取中朝之顯職﹐擅天下之美名。子行穢跡鄙﹐不侔于他士。當礱淬利器﹐以求再捷﹐方可以連衡多士﹐爭霸群英。“生由是益自勤苦﹐聲價彌甚。其年遇大比﹐詔征四方之雋。生應直言極諫策科﹐名第一﹐授成都府參軍。三事以降﹐皆其友也。將之官﹐娃謂生曰﹕“今之復子本軀﹐某不相負也。願以殘年﹐歸養老姥。君當結媛鼎族﹐以奉蒸嘗。中外婚媾﹐無自黷也。勉思自愛﹐某從此去矣。”生泣曰﹕“子若棄我﹐當自剄以就死。”娃固辭不從﹐生勤請彌懇。娃曰﹕“送子涉江﹐至於劍門﹐當令我回。”生許諾。月余﹐至劍門。未及發而除書至﹐生父由常州詔入﹐拜成都尹﹐兼劍南採訪使。浹辰﹐父到。生因投刺﹐謁于郵亭。父不敢認﹐見其祖父官諱﹐方大驚﹐命登階﹐撫背慟哭移時。曰﹕“吾與爾父子如初。”因詰其由﹐具陳其本末。大奇之﹐詰娃安在。曰﹕“送某至此﹐當令復還。”父曰﹕“不可。”翌日﹐命駕與生先之成都﹐留娃于劍門﹐筑別館以處之。明日﹐命媒氏通二姓之好﹐備六禮以迎之﹐遂如秦晉之偶。娃既備禮﹐歲時伏臘﹐婦道甚修﹐治家嚴整﹐極為親所眷尚。後數歲﹐生父母偕歿﹐持孝甚至。有靈芝產于倚廬﹐一穗三秀﹐本道上聞。又有白燕數十﹐巢其層甍。天子異之﹐寵錫加等。終制﹐累遷清顯之任。十年間﹐至數郡。娃封汧國夫人﹐有四子﹐皆為大官﹐其卑者猶為太原尹。弟兄姻媾皆甲門﹐內外隆盛﹐莫之與京。嗟乎﹐倡蕩之姬﹐節行如是﹐雖古先烈女﹐不能逾也。焉得不為之嘆息哉﹗予伯祖嘗牧晉州﹐轉戶部﹐為水陸運使﹐三任皆與生為代﹐故諳詳其事。貞元中﹐予與隴西公佐﹐話婦人操烈之品格﹐因遂述汧國之事。公佐拊掌竦聽﹐命予為傳。乃握管濡翰﹐疏而存之。時乙亥歲秋八月﹐太原白行簡雲。***
