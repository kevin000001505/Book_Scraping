Cai　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　梁公九諫                               [宋]　佚名　　序　　唐中宗皇帝，姓李，諱哲，高宗皇帝之子，母曰則天順聖皇后，姓武氏。先是高宗在位歲久，多苦風疾，不能視朝，百司奏事，皆委則天詳決。則天素多計智，兼涉文史，自此內輔國政，威勢與帝無異。當時稱二聖。高宗崩，中宗即位，未及一月，為裴炎所僭，廢為廬陵王，貶均州。明年又徙房州。則天女主冠冕，法服臨御，以治天下，改唐稱周二十年。於是悉封諸武為王，殺唐之子孫殆盡，堅欲傳位與姪武三思。當時之時，諸武之勢燄如烈火，李唐之族冷如寒灰，何心不隨？何力可回？且中宗豈有復返者乎？且不死為幸爾！賴我梁公貞社稷之臣，捨死不顧，直言極諫，屢以母子性天之道為言，使則天感悟，遂遣使往房州召還，立為皇太子。故中宗得復帝位，而唐祚不移者，皆梁公之力也。　　昔呂溫頌曰：　　　　取日虞淵，洗光咸池，潛授五龍，夾日以飛。忠心與日月同明，本傳與天地同其久然。而世有《梁公九諫》詞者，即趙歧所謂外堂也。傳述既久，舊本多謬，與本傳互有同異，觀者不能無憾。今三復參考，訂其訛而補其闕，不愆不忘，率由舊章，倘博古君子別求明本而正諸，不亦宜乎！　　第一諫　　則天皇帝臨御，廢東宮太子為廬陵王，遂貶房州千里，卻立武三思為儲君。一日會朝，問：「諸卿等意是如何？」諸大臣盡皆拜舞謝敕，山呼萬歲，皆稱：「賀得人矣！」惟有宰相狄公不拜。則天問狄相曰：「策立武三思之事，諸大臣盡皆拜舞謝敕，惟有卿不拜，朕想，卿必有異議。縱有異議，豈勝得殿前八十二員大臣？」狄相奏曰：「不然。若得殿前八十二員大臣比並，事當不可。觀這八十二員大臣見解，似鶴鳩抱卵，豈知鸞鳳之志；螻蟻攻土，豈知晦朔之朝？磨磚作鏡，焉可鑒容；鉛錫為刀，豈堪琢玉？狐狸似犬，愚者養之；苦蔞似瓜，愚者食之。臣觀諸臣，何以異於此？」則天問曰：「問卿策立之事，卿如何將此比並諸大臣？」狄相奏曰：「且如紫微之殿，不是陛下所居之殿。陛下是武家宗祖，唐家國后。緣太子年幼，權請陛下主國，太子長成，社稷合歸唐家枝葉。今諸大臣，未有一人勸陛下以母而立子，卻賀陛下以姑而立姪，是大臣所見不明，陛下所用非賢，故以此事比並諸大臣。據愚臣見解，能斬武三思，仰祭奉天乾陵大帝。東宮之位，合立廬陵王為儲君；若立武三思，終當不得。」　　第二諫　　又一日，則天受朝。狄相奏曰：「太子何罪，遠貶房州千里，圖立姑之位？臣上觀乾象，且無異主之文；中察人心，未厭唐家之德。」則天謂狄相曰：「卿是一個人，爭知天下人心？」狄相奏曰：「昔陛下在長安之日，有北方單于寇擾唐邑。緣何先帝存日，不與交戰？彼時兵寡，故不與敵。遂將兩庫金帛，命梁王武三思招召，要軍千萬，與單于戰，前後十餘月，招召人數，不滿千百。及廬陵王代之，不經旬日，計兵千萬。單于探得，不戰自退。以愚臣見解，度量天下人心，未厭唐家之意。東宮之位，合立廬陵王為儲君，武三思終當不得。」　　第三諫　　又一日，則天問狄相曰：「卿云：『上觀乾象，且無異主之文。』朕自為君以來，有什麼聖明？有什麼無道？」狄相奏曰：「陛下為君以來，聖明似不少，無道亦絕多。陛下在長安之日，有龍鳳來儀，麒麟來現。岱州進表，有八百里地方麥麩金。長安元年十二月上旬，花發。駕幸東都，有鳳現。回紇進五色龜，日南進二角犀，藕州進鱷獸，西方佛足現。光宅二年，洛河泛漲，漂出一石函，函內有鐵札，篆書金字云：『武后登萬萬年。』」則天問曰：「上觀乾象，且無異主之文，惟復是朕登萬萬年，惟復是武家子孫登萬萬年？」狄相奏曰：「臣聞古人有言：『有聞必先，有兆必應。』天地現相，陰陽泄機，在乎人自應之耳。愚臣不敏，試論年代應萬萬之數，陛下為判。陛下在長安之日，改元嗣聖元年，又改垂拱元年，又改□□元年，又改永昌元年，又改天授元年，又改如意元年，又改長壽元年，又改光宅元年，又改延載元年。東都有五鳳現，又改五鳳元年，又改萬歲通天元年，又改神功元年，又改聖曆元年，又改久視元年。西方佛足現，又改大足元年，又改萬歲登封元年，又改長安元年。以愚臣見解，陛下即位以來，改元之中有兩個萬歲元年，暗合萬萬年之數足矣。定東宮之位，非廬陵王不可；立武三思，的然不得。」　　第四諫　　則天問狄曰：「卿云朕自為君以來，聖明亦不少，前言亦備矣，無道亦絕多，試與朕說之。」狄相奏曰：「太子何罪？遠貶房州千里，擬立武三思為儲君。陛下是女主，爭斷得三從五逆？」則天問曰：「何名三從五逆？」狄相奏曰：「三從者：在家從父，出嫁從夫，夫殃從子。五逆者：在家不從父，出嫁不從夫，夫殃不從子，是三逆；陛下親兒，遠貶房州，是四逆；立姪為儲君，是五逆。愚臣直奏，輕觸龍顏。東宮之位，非廬陵王不可；立武三思，終當不得。」　　第五諫　　則天聞狄相所奏，即命武士撮出，放大臣散。遂憑玉案略睡。少時，乃得一夢，見湘輪水上流，車向壁上行，忽然驚覺。次日受朝，問門下侍郎張易之：「朕昨日略憑玉案，略睡少時，忽得一夢，見湘輪水上流，車向壁上行，此夢如何？」張易之曰：「助陛下好夢。輪者，周流不息，乾道也，上應乎天，為陛下治世之象；水者，陰道也，是陛下之命。上流者，大吉之兆，永保千秋；又夢車向壁上行，緣陛下聖朝蓋代，四夷來降，八表來朝，天下貢獻至多。道路隘窄，感這車向壁上行。」則天大悅，顏動龍顏，賜易之珠金重寶，諸臣山呼萬歲。惟有狄相不拜。則天乃問狄相曰：「卿何不拜？朕所夢家私事，莫不見否？」狄相奏曰：「臣只見陛下邦國事，不見陛下家私事。陛下所夢，湘輪水上流，車向壁上行，張易之園夢云輪是陛下身，水是陛下命，乃曲媚取容，苟圖金寶。臣圓此夢，於國不祥。夫水者，陰道也。水望低流，本性也。車同軌，公道也。今水不望下而望上流，是陰氣上盛而逆其天也；車向壁上行，是無道也。陛下親兒遠貶房州，擬立武三思為儲君，此實為無道也。東宮之位，非廬陵王不可；立武三思，決然不得。」　　第六諫　　則天睡至三更，又得一夢。夢與大羅天女對手著棋，局中有子，旋被打將，頻輸天女，忽然驚覺。來日受朝，問諸大臣：「其夢如何？」狄相奏曰：「臣圓此夢，於國不祥。陛下夢與大羅天女對手著棋，局中有子，旋被打將，頻輸天女，蓋謂局中有子，不得其位，旋被打將，失其所主。今太子廬陵王貶房州千里，是謂局中有子，不得其位，遂感此夢。臣願東宮之位，速立廬陵王為儲君；若立武三思，終當不得。」　　第七諫　　則天不豫，狄相入閣門問疾。則天曰：「我夢鸚鵡雙翅折，其夢如何？」狄相奏曰：「武者，陛下之姓，相王、廬陵王乃陛下之雙翅也。今皆遠貶，遂感此夢。」時武三思在傍，怒發赤色。則天令武士撮出朝門。乃問侍臣曰：「狄相與卿等意何如？」張易之奏曰：「狄相家貧，若多賜金寶，便可策立武三思為儲君。」則天遂賞色羅十車、珠金兩床、御衣百箱，排於殿前，令武士召狄相入朝。則天曰：「為子逆父，為臣逆君，祗緣策立之事，卿每偏執，苦諫於朕，朕甚恥之。卿若不改見前解，只這殿前，是卿死處；若改見前解，取此賞物。」狄相奏曰：「不然。憶昔太宗大帝在日，經綸四海，勇滅大隋，收王世充，戮竇建德，八十二處草賊，鞍不離馬背，甲不離將身，親冒矢石，以定天下，皆為後世子孫，可不為李家枝葉？臣意宏道元命先帝臨崩之夜，以愛子托陛下，以社稷囑付大臣，臣今受此賞物，卻立外姓，是臣賣卻唐家社稷。臣往九泉之下，無面可見高宗大帝。臣惟守直而死，不可邪佞而生。東宮之位，合立廬陵王為儲君；若立武三思，的然不當。」　　第八諫　　則天令武士於殿前置油鍋，宣狄相入朝。則天問狄相曰：「若改見前解，則與卿長保富貴；若不改見前解，這殿前油鍋是卿死處。」狄相奏曰：「臣當年邁，佐陛下邦國不得，策立之事，便合依從，不合違赦。據臣罪愆，合當萬死。容臣徵古，死亦不遲。」則天曰：「徵古之事，如何？」狄相奏曰：「徵古者，以太子天下根本，本以搖而天下皆動。陛下以一心之欲，輕天下之動哉！且姑之與姪孰近？子之與母更親。寧學寒蟬潔饑，不學螳螂戲飽；乍立廬陵王而死，不立武三思而生。陛下長如今日，則萬事絕言。若也萬歲之後，將武三思為儲君，只將武家宗祖，於太廟享祭，自古宗廟，無祔姑之禮，陛下有何干預？若立廬陵王為儲君，陛下萬歲之後，四時祭奠無虧。如此，姑之與姪孰近？子之與母孰親？東宮之位，合廬陵王為儲君；立武三思，終當不得。」復前奏曰：「臣既不得策立太子，即以死報先帝。復願陛下以老臣之言熟思之，以萬世無疆之計。」言訖，褰衣大步欲跳入油鍋，則天連聲叫武士執其裾，曰：「朕從今日起，依卿所奏。」　　第九諫　　則天因此感悟，遂遣中使往房州，密召廬陵王為嗣。廬陵王引咎韜晦，久處房陵，勝得民情，舉留不放。遂佯為放鷹，隊仗出城。至於南山，矯衣而入，坐於中宮，外人無有知者。又遣黃門，宣狄相入朝，賜坐於簾外。則天謂曰：「我欲立武三思，群臣無有異議者。唯卿不從，幾欲致卿於死地。前日見卿所奏，朕心豁然，方見利害。已依卿所奏，遣使已召廬陵，現到中宮，與卿相見。」命左右褰簾，命廬陵王拜公。公見太子，謂二十餘年不見太子動靜，雖殺身成仁，不審大位果能正否？及見太子，嗚咽流涕，殞絕於地。則天命左右起之，以手拊公背曰：「豈朕之臣，乃社稷之臣也。」已而顧謂太子曰：「今日國老與汝作天子。」狄相奏曰：「未可。陛下當年貶太子往房州，天下人知。今太子歸朝，宰相尚有不知者，還宮無儀，知是誰立？」則天曰：「據國老所見，如何得立？」狄相奏曰：「伏請太子往龍門，望降召發親王宗正，相率百官，備禮以迎，便可策立。」則天曰：「依卿所奏。」廬陵王因狄相，策立為唐家第四帝，後廟號中宗。　　跋　　《梁公九諫》一卷，賜書樓藏舊鈔本，此載諸讀書敏求記中者也。今此本有賜書樓圖記，字跡又舊，則其為述古堂物無疑。賜書樓未知誰氏，余所藏張無崖集，宋闕鈔補者。每葉板心皆刻賜書樓所鈔，字跡審是明人書，未知即此家否？此本卷中首葉有辨之印。此姑餘山人沈與文也。尾葉有一印，其文曰「姑蘇吳岫家藏」，此吳方山也。皆吾郡中人。二人皆明嘉靖時人，皆藏書家，則此書之珍重由來已久。偶為他邑所得，而仍歸郡中。物之流傳，固自有異，然更得也。是翁一番記述。不愈足引重乎！　　　　嘉慶癸亥三月朔，黃丕烈書。　　題書紀事詩，久絕響矣。即欲為三益聯吟之續，而良友弗聚，異書不來，意興殊索然也。閒窗檢點舊藏，出此《梁公九諫》一卷，仍用舊例，獨吟新詩，亦聊為破寂之助云爾：　　九諫詞猶在，文章振李唐。　　安危資柱石，舉廢得津梁。　　氣挾雷霆厲，心爭日月光。　　名臣傳表奏，應比賜書藏。
