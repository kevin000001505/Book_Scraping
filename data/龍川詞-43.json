Liang水調歌頭（送章徳茂大卿使金）不見南師乆，謾説北羣空。當塲隻手，畢竟還我萬夫雄。自笑堂堂漢使，得似洋洋河水，依舊只流東。且復穹廬拜，會向藳街逢。 堯之都，舜之壤，禹之封，於中應有，一個半個挽琱弓。萬裏烽煙如許，千古英靈安在，磅礴幾時通。世運何湏問，赫日自當中。又（癸夘九月十五日壽朱元晦）人物從來少，籬菊為誰黃。去年今日，倚樓還是聽行藏。未覺霜風無賴，好在月華如水，心事楚天長。講論叅洙泗，盃酒到虞唐。 人未醉，歌宛轉，興悠揚，太平胸次，笑他磊磈欲成狂。且向武夷深處，坐對雲煙開歛，逸思入微茫。我欲為君夀，何許得新腔。又（和吳允成逰靈洞韻）人愛新來景，龍認舊時湫。不論三伏，小住便覺凜生秋。我自醉眠其上，任是水流其下，湍激若為収。世事如斯去，不去為誰留。 本無心，隨所寓。觸虗舟，東山始末，且向靈洞與沈浮。料得神仙窟穴，爭似提封萬裏，大小幾琉球，但有君才具，何用問時流。又（和趙周錫）事業隨人品，今古幾麾旌。向來謀國，萬事盡出汝書生。安識鵾鵬變化，九萬裏風在下，如許上南溟。斥鷃旁邊笑，河漢一頭傾。 嘆世間，多少恨。幾時平，覇圖消歇，大家創見又成驚。邂逅漢家龍種，正爾烏紗白紵，馳騖覺身輕。樽酒從渠說，雙眼為誰明。念奴嬌（至金陵）江南春色，筭來是，多少勝遊清賞。妖冶廉纖，只做得，飛鳥向人偎傍。地闢天開，精神朗慧，到底還京様，人家小語，一聲聲近清唱。 因念舊日山城，個人如畫，已作中州想。鄧禹笑人無限也，冷落不堪惆悵。秋水雙明，高山一弄，著我些悲壯，南徐好住，片帆有分來往。又（登多景樓）危樓還望，嘆此意，今古幾人曾會。龜設神施，渾認作，天限南疆圵界。一水橫陳，連崗三面，做出爭雄勢。六朝何事，只成門戶私計。 因笑王謝諸人，登髙懐逺，也學英雄涕。憑卻江山管不到，河洛祲氛無際。正好長驅，不須反顧，尋取中流誓，小兒破賊，勢成寧問彊對。又（送戴少望叅選）西風帶暑，又還是，長途利牽名役。我已無心，君因甚，更把青衫為客。邂逅卑飛，幾時高舉，不露真消息。大家行處，到頭須管行得。 何處尋取狂徒，可能著意，更問渠儂骨。天上人間，最好是，閙裏一般岑寂。瀛海無波，玉堂有路，穏著青霄翼。歸來何事，眼光依舊生碧。賀新郎（同劉元實唐與正陪葉丞相飲）脩竹更深處，映簾櫳，清陰障日，坐來無暑。水激泠泠知何許，跳碎危欄玉樹。都不繫，人間朝莫。東閣少年今老矣，況樽中有酒嫌推去，猶著我名流語。大家綠野陪容與，筭等閒，過了薫風，又還商素。手弄柔條人健否，猶憶當時雅趣。恩未報，恐成辜負，舉目江河休感涕，念有君，如此應忘阻，歌未罷，誰來舞？又（寄辛幼安和見懷韻）老去慿誰說，看幾番，神奇臭腐，夏裘冬葛。父老長安今餘幾，後死無讐可雪。猶未燥，當時生髪。二十五弦多少恨，筭世間，那有平分月，羌婦弄漢宮瑟。樹猶如此堪重別，只使君，從來與我，話頭多合，行矣置之無足問，誰換妍皮癡骨。但莫使，伯牙絃絶。九轉丹砂牢拾取，管精金，只是鐵，龍共虎，聲應裂。又（酧辛幼安再用韻見寄）離亂從頭說，愛吾民，金繒不愛，蔓藤纍葛。壯筆盡消人脆好，冠蓋陰山觀雪。虧殺我，一星星髪，涕出女吳成倒轉，問魯為齊，弱何年月，丘也幸，由之瑟。斬新換出旗麾別，把當時，一樁大義，拆開収合。據地一呼吾徃矣，萬裏搖肢動骨。這話覇，只成癡絶，天地洪爐誰扇韝，算於中，安得長堅鐵，淝水破，闗東裂。又（懐辛幼安用前韻）話殺渾閒說，不成教，齊民也解，為伊為葛，樽酒相逢成二老，卻憶去年風雪，新著了，幾莖華髪。百世尋人猶接踵，嘆只今兩地三人月，冩舊恨，向誰瑟。男兒何用傷離別，況古來，幾畨際會，風從雲合。千裏情親長晤對，妙體本心次骨。臥百尺，髙樓鬥絶，天下適安耕且老，看買犁賣劎平家鐵，壯士淚，肺肝裂。滿江紅（懐韓子師尚書）曾洗乾坤，問何事，雄圖頓屈。試著眼，階除當下，又添英物。圵向爭衡幽憤在，南來遺恨狂酋失。算淒涼部曲幾人存，三之一。 諸老盡，郎君出，恩未報，家何恤。念橫飛直上，有時還戢。笑我只知存飽煗，感君原不論階級。休更上百尺舊家樓，塵侵帙。桂枝香（觀木樨有感寄呂郎中）天高氣肅，正月色分明，秋容新沐，桂子初収，三十六宮都足。不辭散落人間去，怕羣花，自嫌凡俗。向他秋晚，喚囘春意，幾曾幽獨。 是天公，餘香賸馥，怪一樹香風，十裏相續。坐對花旁，但見色浮金粟。芙蓉只解添愁思，況東籬，淒涼黃菊，入時太淺，背時太逺，愛尋髙躅。三部樂（七月送丘宗卿使金）小屈穹廬，但二滿三平，共勞均佚。人中龍虎，本為明時而出。只合是，端坐王朝。看指揮整辦，埽蕩飄忽。也持漢節，聊過舊家宮室。 西風又還帶暑，把征衫著上，有時披拂，休將看花淚眼，聞絃病骨。對遺民，有如皎日，行萬裏，依然故物，入奏幾策，天下裏，終定於一。又（七月卄六日壽王道甫）入腳西風，漸去去來來，早三之一。春花無數，畢竟何如秋實。不須待，名品如麻，試為君屈指，是誰層出。十朝半月，爭看摶空霜鶻。 從來別真共假，任盤根錯節，更饒倉卒。還他濟時好手，封侯奇骨。沒些兒，媻姍勃窣，也不是，崢嶸突兀。百二十歲，管做徹，元分人物。瑞雪濃慢（六月十一日壽羅春伯）蔗漿酪粉，玉壺氷醑，朝罷更聞宣賜。去天咫尺，下拜再三，幸今有母可遺。年年此日，共道月入懷中最貴。向暑天，正風雲會遇，有恁嘉瑞。 鶴沖霄，魚得水，一超便，直入神仙地。植根江表，開拓兩河，做得黒頭公未。騎鯨赤手，問何如，長鞭尺箠。向來王謝風流，只今管是。阮郎歸（重午壽外舅）波光渺渺浸晴陂，有亭湖岸西。芰荷香拂栁絲垂，升堂獻壽巵。 紅約腕，緑侵衣。願祝屇期頤。花間妙語欲無詩，一年歌一詞。祝英臺近（六月十一日送葉正則如江陵）駕扁舟，衝劇暑。千裏江上去，夜宿晨興。一一舊時路。百年忘了旬頭，被人攙破，故紙裏，是爭雄處。 怎生訴，欲待細與分疏，其如有憑據。包裹生魚，活底怎遭遇。相逢樽酒何時，征衫容易，君去也，自家須住。又（九月一日壽兪德載）嫩寒天，金氣雨，攬斷一秋事。仝様霏微，還作小晴意。世間萬寶都成，些兒無欠，只待與，黃花為地。 好招致，對此鬱鬱蔥蔥，新篘未成醉。番手為雲，造物等兒戱，也知冨貴來時，一班呈露，便做出人中祥瑞。蝶戀花（甲辰夀元晦）手撚黃花還自笑，笑比淵明，莫也歸來早。隨世功名渾草草，五湖卻共繁華老。 冷淡家生寃得道，旖旎妖嬈，春夢如今覺。管領歲華須到了，此花之後花應少。蔔算子（九月十八日夀徐子才）悄靜菊花天，洗盡梧桐雨。倍九週遭爛漫開，祝壽當頭取。 頂戴禦袍黃，疉秀金稜吐。仙種花容晚節香，人願爭先覩。垂絲釣（九月七日自壽）菊花細雨，蕭蕭紅蓼汀渚。景物漸幽，風致如許。秋未莫，又值吾初度。 看天宇，正澄淸欲往。登髙未也，紅塵當面飛舞。幾人弔古，烏帽牢收取。短髪還羞覷，遐壽身，近五雲深處。彩鳯飛（一作彩鳯舞七月十六日壽錢伯同）人立玉，天如水，特地如何撰。海南沈燒著，欲寒猶煗。算從頭，有多少，厚徳陰功，人家上，一一舊時香案，煞經慣。 小駐吾州纔爾，依然歡聲滿。莫也教，公子王孫眼見。這些兒，頴脫處，髙出書巻，經綸自入手，不了判斷。鷓鴣天（懐王道甫）落魄行歌記昔逰，頭顱如許尚何求。心肝吐盡無餘事，口腹安然豈逺謀。 纔怕暑，又傷秋，天涯夢斷有書不。大都眼孔新來淺，羨爾微官作計周。謁金門（送徐子宜如新安）新雨足，洗盡山城袢溽。見說好峯三十六，峯峯如立玉。 四海英逰追逐，事業相時伸縮。入境徳星須做福，只愁金詔趣。天仙子（七月十五日壽內）一夜秋光先著栁，暑力平明羞失守。西風不放入簾幃，饒永晝，沈煙透。半月十朝秋定否。 指點芙蕖凝佇久，髙處成蓮深處藕。百年長共月團圎，女進酒，男稱夀。一點浮雲人似舊。洞仙歌（丁未夀朱元晦）秋容一洗，不受凡塵涴。許大乾坤這囘大，向上頭，些子是鵰鶚摶空。籬底下，只有黃花幾朶。 騎鯨汗漫，那得人同坐。赤手丹心撲不破，問唐虞，禹湯武多少功名，猶自是，一點浮雲鏟過，且燒卻，一瓣海南沈，任拈取，千年陸沈竒貨。踏莎行（懐葉八十推官）書冊如仇，舊逰渾諱，有懐不斷人應異。千山上去夢魂輕，片帆似下蠻溪水。 已共酒盃，長堅海■，見君忽忘花前醉。從來解事苦無多，不知解到毫芒未。南鄉子（謝永嘉諸友相餞）人物滿東甌，別我江心識俊逰。北盡平蕪南似畫，中流，誰繫龍驤萬斛舟。 去去幾時休，猶是潮來更上頭。醉墨淋漓人感舊，離愁，一夜西風似夏不。點絳唇（詠梅月）一夜相思，水邊清淺橫枝瘦。小窻如晝，情共香俱透。 清入夢魂，千裏人長乆。君知否，雨僝雲僽，格調還依舊。龍川詞●龍川詞跋同甫，一名同，永康人。光宗策進士，羣臣奏其巻第三，禦筆擢第一。既知為同甫，大喜。又有天留遺朕之詔，其恩遇如此。據葉水心序，其集雲四十巻，今行本止三十巻。想尚多佚遺，其最著者，莫如上皇帝四書及酌古論，自贊雲：人中之龍，文中之虎。真無忝矣。第本集載詞選三十闋。無甚詮次。如寄辛幼安、賀新郎三首，錯見前後。予家蔵《龍川詞》一巻，又每調類分，未知孰是。讀至巻終，不作一妖語媚語，殆所稱不受人憐者歟。湖南毛晉識。●龍川詞補遺水龍吟（春恨）閙花深處層樓，畫簾半捲東風軟。春歸翠陌，平莎茸嫩，垂楊金淺。遲日催花，淡雲閣雨，輕寒輕煗。恨芳菲世界，遊人未嘗，都付與，鸎和燕。 寂莫憑髙念逺，向南樓，一聲歸雁。金釵鬭草，青絲勒馬，風流雲散，羅綬分香，翠綃封淚，幾多幽怨。正銷魂，又是疎煙淡月，子規聲斷。洞仙歌（雨）瑣窗秋莫，夢髙唐人困，獨立西風萬千恨。又檐花落處，滴碎空堦，芙容院，無限秋容老盡。 枯荷摧欲折，多少離聲，鎖斷天涯訴幽悶。似蓬山去後，方士來時，揮粉淚，點點梨花香潤。斷送得，人間夜霖鈴，更葉落梧桐，孤燈成暈。虞美人（春愁）東風蕩颺輕雲縷，時送蕭蕭雨。水邊臺榭燕新歸，一口香泥濕帶，落花飛。 海棠糝徑鋪香繡，依舊成春痩。黃昏庭院栁啼鴉，記得那人和月，折梨花。眼兒媚（春愁）試燈天氣又春來，難說是情懐。寂寥聊似，揚州何遜，不為江梅。 扶頭酒醒爐香灺，心緒未全灰。愁人最是，黃昏前後，煙雨樓臺。思佳客（春感）花拂闌幹栁拂空，花枝綽約栁鬟鬆。蝶翻淡碧低邊影，鶯囀濃香杪處風。 深院落，小簾櫳，尋芳猶憶舊相逢。橋邊攜手歸來路，踏皺殘花幾片紅。清平樂（秋晚，伯成兄徃龍興山中，意其登山臨水，不無閨房之思。作此詞惱之。）銀屏繡閣，不道鮫綃薄。嘶騎囪囪塵漠漠，還過夕陽村落。 亂山千疊無情，今宵遮斷愁人。兩處香消夢覺，一般曉月秋聲。滴滴金斷橋雪霽聞啼鳥，對林花，弄晴曉。畫角吹香客愁醒，見梢頭紅小。 團酥剪蠟知多少，向風前，壓春倒。江嶂人煙畫圖中，有短篷香繞。 龍川詞補遺●龍川詞補遺跋余正喜同甫，不作妖語媚語。偶閲中興詞選，得水龍吟，以後七闋亦未能超然。但無一調合本集者。或雲：贋作。葢花菴與同甫俱南渡後人，何至誤謬若此。或花菴專選綺艷一種，而同甫子沈所編本集，特表阿翁磊落骨幹，故若出二手。況本集雲：詞選則知同甫之詞，不止於三十闋，即補此花菴所選，亦安得雲全豹耶。姑梓之以俟。博雅君子湖南毛晉又識。*** END OF THE PROJECT
